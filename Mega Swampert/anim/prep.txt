i wanna prepare this limb file for animation,
 so export the groups, like forearm with upperarm,
  or left arm, or just forearm, or just left finger
 cluster, if there is already grouped objects in 
 the file, you can use that, also export the pose 
 functions, like translate,scale,rotate, etc for 
 each groups in that file, then i can import those
  functions in a separate animation file, 
  then i can apply that animation file 
  into the file i render the model in
